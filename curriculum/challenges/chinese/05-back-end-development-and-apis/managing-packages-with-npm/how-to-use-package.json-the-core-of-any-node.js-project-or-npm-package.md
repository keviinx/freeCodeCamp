# --description--

你可以采用下面的任意一种编写代码的方式来完成这些挑战：

- 克隆<a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">这个 GitHub 仓库</a>，并在本地完成这些挑战。
- 使用<a href="https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">我们在 Replit 上的初始化项目</a>来完成这些挑战。
- 使用你选择的网站生成器来完成项目。 需要包含我们 GitHub 仓库的所有文件。

If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:

-   Start by importing the project on Replit.
-   Next, you will see a `.replit` window.
-   Select `Use run command` and click the `Done` button.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the `Solution Link` field.

The `package.json` file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project, similar to how the &lt;head> section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. There are only two required fields; "name" and "version", but it’s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.

If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the package.json file on the top level of the tree. This is the file that you will be improving in the next couple of challenges.

One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the `author` field. It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details. An object is recommended for bigger projects, but a simple string like the following example will do for this project.

```json
"author": "Jane Doe",
```

# --instructions--

Add your name as the `author` of the project in the package.json file.

**Note:** Remember that you’re writing JSON, so all field names must use double-quotes (") and be separated with a comma (,).

# --hints--

package.json should have a valid "author" key

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/package.json').then(
    (data) => {
      var packJson = JSON.parse(data);
      assert(packJson.author, '"author" is missing');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
